 1.Hadoop in layman's term:

          * Hadoop is an open-source,java based framework.
          * It provides a reliable & a scalable platform for storage and processing.
          * The key component's involved are:
                                 a.HDFS
                                 b.Map Reduce
                                   
         *The 2 key concept's are:
                                  a.Storage
                                  b.Processing

2. Components of Hadoop framework:

          The 2 main component's of Hadoop are,

    a.HDFS - * Abbrevated as Hadoop distributed file system 
             *It is used for mass storage of data and results.

    b.Map Reduce - *It is a framework which is used for the processings that includes the analysis of data.
                   *It can be further divided as
                                                $Pig
                                                $Hive

3. Reasons to learn Big data technologies:

     =>Business Reasons:

           * With the new style of IT emerging,the amount of data generated are huge.
           * Inorder to support/store such huge amounts of data efficiently,there is a need for technologies like bigdata. 

     =>Personal Reasons:

           *The demand for Big Data skills is extremely high.
           *The average payscale of professionals with Big Data expertise is comparitively very high.
